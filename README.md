<h5>Features and Tests:</h5>

> API-Challenge delivers regression models comparing the relationship between latitude and temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and windspeed in both hemispheres. API-Challenge also delivers two maps, one map visualizing the humidity of each country in the dataset, and the other map locating hotels in ideal vacation destinations. At the time of deployment, the Geoapify API encountered a 400 error, so no hotels were generated, unfortunately.
